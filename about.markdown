### Who is this chump?
My name is Adam, a New Zealander currently finding himself in the middle of a bunch of snow and lakes up in Toronto, Canada.

### What does this chump do?
I'm currently working as a Public Cloud Architect in the Financial Sector, spending most of my days trying to figure out how and why AWS and Azure decided to do what they do, and make it work without causing too much of a fuss. 

Most of the stuff on these pages probably have to do with the stuff I encounter on the rollercoaster ride that is the Public Cloud.

### Is that it?

I also like Video Games a little too much, as well as doing dumb stuff on Motorcycles and Mountain Bikes. Sometimes I might shout into the void on these subject as well.

### Where else do you live?
